so when you put periods its going to dive deeper into more detail about a line of code. The example the provide was an adress which makes sense your just
going deeper and deeper into what you can make your line of code do.. and { is bascially one block of code it should have everything your planning on doing with 
some code.. you can and will have { inside of { and they shoould be tabbed in so they line up.. and ; is basically like a . for a english sentance it ends one line of code.
