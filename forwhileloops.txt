For while loops confuse me the most but they are for as much as i can understand they use arrays. goes through each of the items in the array and runs the loops.

public class ForeachLoop : MonoBehaviour 
{   
    void Start () 
    {
        string[] strings = new string[3];
        
        strings[0] = "First string";
        strings[1] = "Second string";
        strings[2] = "Third string";
        
        foreach(string item in strings)
        {
            print (item);
        }
    }
}
